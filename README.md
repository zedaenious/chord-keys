Playing around with a front end for getting help with some guitar chord theory stuff. Current iteration just uses local data to show the diatonic scale notes for a given major or minor chord key.

I'd like to add in some tablature for the individual notes on the scale, as a lot of them are not obvious (I'm looking at you `Câ™­m5`);

To run dev build:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run less:watch // shell 1
$ npm run build:dev // shell 2
```
